    <pre id="title">Heart of the Mafia</pre>
    <pre id="Chapter">Chapter 1</pre>
    <pre id="story">A world where everyone has their own fears and weaknesses, a man named Denzo has none. He is a perfectionist, even about his appearance, allowing no flaws. Denzo does not let any emotion get in his way, and he is a genius with an IQ surpassing Albert Einstein's, scoring at 240.</pre>
    <pre id="story">But one day, something unexpected happens.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (secretary): Boss, here’s the status of our businesses. According to the profit reports, things are going well.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a poker face and a dangerous gaze): Hand it over.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (gazing flirtatiously at her boss): Here you go, boss.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (still with a poker face and a dangerous gaze): The report says our business profits have dropped by a percentage. We need a 300% profit margin. I want you to investigate why this is happening.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (thinking about how cool and handsome he always is): Okay, boss.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (in a very masculine voice): I also want you to get me our CEO’s bank account information and hand it over.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (a bit surprised): Sure, I'll be back, boss.</pre>
    <pre id="story">Meanwhile, in Francine’s life...</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (with a lovely expression and a smile): Hello, my little baby, Laurel. I made breakfast for you, so make sure to eat it before going to school.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Laurel (with a sad expression): You again? Where’s Mom? I’m jealous of the kids at school whose moms or dads always drop them off.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (turns her head slightly, with a touch of sadness): I still have a lot to do, but you can eat now, and I’ll drop you off afterward.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Laurel (with a sad face, eating his food): Okay.</pre>
    <pre id="story">---</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine drops Laurel off at school.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (with a happy face): Bye! Love you, baby!</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Laurel (in a hurry): Okay.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (a bit sad): Don’t you want to say "I love you" back to your sister?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Laurel pretends he didn’t hear it and heads inside the school.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (with a bit of sadness): That kid… I can’t blame him either.</pre>
    <pre id="story">...In Denzo’s Life...</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo stands up from his chair and heads to his basement, where all his vehicles are stored. He picks his black bike to ride to a meeting with a client.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">This client isn’t just any average client but a major business owner who wants to buy gold and weapons from him. Denzo has also created a laboratory for futuristic weapons, which he sells. Riding at full speed, he controls 80% of the traffic flow, flanked by his men in bulletproof cars and motorcycles, all black with the logo of their mafia.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo even has deals with the president since the country is deeply corrupt.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo arrives at his destination. A large number of men are waiting for him, all in suits. Denzo's bodyguards surround him, and they enter a large restaurant that the client bought out just for this meeting.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo sits at the table and begins to talk.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Client (with a smile on his face and a greedy look of power): Oh, there you are. You arrived exactly on time. You really are a perfectionist.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious and dangerous look): Let’s get to the point. What do you want to buy?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Client (laughing): You are very unfriendly. I guess the rumors are true—you have no emotion. I like that. I want to buy gold worth 50 billion dollars and futuristic weapons worth another 50 billion.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (a bit disappointed): I guess you don’t really know me, do you?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo stands up and turns his back.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Client (laughing, looking proud): You’ve passed the test, and now you have my trust. I want you to be my supplier, and I'll give you five businesses worth billions of dollars.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious look as he sits down again): I see. I guess you do know me.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Client (smiling confidently): Of course, you’re the man who meets clients not for money but for business property. Even if it’s 500 billion dollars, you still won’t accept it.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious look): Sure. You can count on me.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo shakes the client’s hand, signs the contracts, and goes outside, getting into a car.</pre>
    <pre id="story">---</pre>
    <pre id="storys">...On the phone with Lorenza...</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious yet smiling face): Kill him...</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (giggling at his masculine voice): Understood, boss.</pre>
    <pre id="story">---</pre>
    <pre id="storys">...On the phone with the President...</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (with a smirk on her face): Mr. President? Would you mind lending me a missile? Just one, big enough for a restaurant.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (with excitement and happiness at the thought of money): How much are we talking about?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (with a serious face and sultry voice): Just a billion dollars.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (surprised): Do you think that's enough?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (smirking): I might need to tell my boss that you declined our offer.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (with fear): No! Wait, I accept!</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (serious): How sure are you?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (with fear): You can just offer me 100 million dollars.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (in a teasing tone): So you’re not 100% sure, are you?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (nervous): I’ll do it for free! Just please don’t say anything to him.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (playfully): I want to buy it. How much?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (with confusion and sadness): I’ll sell it for 5 billion dollars.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (happily): Come on, don’t be afraid; I’ll buy it for 50 billion dollars.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (confused and surprised): Thank you! Sure, I’ll do it. Send me the location.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza returns to Denzo’s office and hands over the CEO's bank information, telling him about the conversation with the President.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious gaze): Checkmate.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (confused): Why, boss?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious gaze and a hint of anger): Summon all the CEOs at the golf course tomorrow. Tell them we’re going to have some fun together.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (still confused): Sure, I’ll do it.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">The next day, Denzo arrives at the golf course on horseback, with his men. He has taken some of the CEOs' families hostage.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a smile): To make this day more enjoyable, I brought your families along so we can have more fun.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Everyone is worried except Denzo, as he is the only one who doesn't have any empathy.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a smile): All of you, listen to me! If you can shoot that ball into the hole you see there, that is the goal. Now, if you miss, one of your family members will die.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">The CEO responds (with worry and some crying): "Yes, Mr. Chairman."</pre>
    <pre id="storys">As Denzo watched them, he saw an object that needed to be disposed of. In other words, he saw them as trash because of their actions. Denzo treated them like objects, with no sign of guilt. None of the CEOs shot the ball because it was almost impossible. Even a professional golf player couldn't make that shot from that range.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a cold gaze): Since all of you missed the goal, I will fulfill our agreement.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo left and said:</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a smirk): By the way, the family member I'm talking about is the one who shot and missed.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo left the scene and began searching for food. Despite what had happened, he continued with his day. Denzo then rode in his car, surrounded by multiple vehicles guarding him. As always, he controlled the traffic lights, and all the cars began to move in his direction, even if they were far away, waiting for him to pass.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">But suddenly, a girl who loved her little boy forgot to pick him up and ran to his school in a panic, fearing someone might kidnap him. She didn’t hear the alert or the sign that the way needed to be clear for Denzo. As she crossed the street, Denzo, seated in his car, almost crushed her. Denzo saw the woman and felt something he had never felt before—a brief moment of worry for others. He grabbed the wheel of his driver’s car and quickly moved away so she wouldn't be hit.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">That quick response proved Denzo was a genius. The girl said and collapsed:</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (with shock): "What just happened?"</pre>
    <pre id="storys">After she collapsed, her little boy cried and ran to grab her.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a relieved look): "Don't worry, she just collapsed."</pre>
    <pre id="storys">The boy punched him, and all of his bodyguards and people were shocked. They stopped and began to worry about the child.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Someone (with worry): "That kid’s gonna get killed."</pre>  
    <pre id="storys">Someone (with worry): "Dumbass, what do you think you're doing?"</pre>
    <pre id="story">---</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a smile): "Don't worry, kid. I’ll take care of her. It's my responsibility after all."</pre>
    <pre id="storys">He touched the boy’s head and carried the woman to his car.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a poker face): "Come on, kid."</pre>
    <pre id="storys">The girl woke up, looked at her younger brother, and the boy hugged her tightly.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (smiling): "I'm okay, don’t worry."Then suddenly (with a shocked expression): "Oh! I remember the car! I hope I didn’t cause an accident!"</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Laurel (smiling): "Don’t worry, big sis. The old man is responsible, and he helped you."</pre>
    <pre id="storys">And the boy point Denzo</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo(with poker face): don't worry about it nothing really happen i have to go now</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine stood up, ran to him, and grabbed his hands. She repeatedly said, "I’m sorry! I almost caused an accident because I was rushing. It’s my fault. How can I repay you?"</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Diego (shocked, while looking into her eyes): "Don’t worry about it."</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine was stunned when she noticed several men in suits nearby.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Diego left the hospital without another word.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (still in shock): "Wait, why is my room so nice?"</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Suddenly, multiple nurses entered her room, offering her food, a massage, and speaking to her with flattering words.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (confused): "What’s going on? Is that guy the president of the country or something?"</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Laurel (smiling): "Big sis, there’s a lot of food here. Come and eat! They’re even massaging me now!"</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (confused): "Is that really part of a nurse’s job, though?"</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Nurses (smiling): "Don’t worry about it, miss."</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Meanwhile, Denzo was on a call with Lorenza.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (excitedly): "Hello, boss! I’m in the shower right now. What do you need?"</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a poker face): "I want to meet you in the office. Right now."</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (thinking with excitement): Denzo, I’m not ready! Is he going to confess his love? I mean, I’m literally the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen.(Actual response): "Yes, boss!"</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza picked out the most luxurious and beautiful dress she could find. As she walked to the office, all the men stared at her, unable to take their eyes off her. Lorenza, with a background in modeling and martial arts, was no stranger to admiration. She was also a genius in her younger days, dedicating herself solely to personal growth and never getting a boyfriend.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza entered the office with confidence and sat down.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a poker face): "There’s a girl I need you to look into."</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (thinking): Ah, as always, this is about business. It’s impossible for the boss to take an interest in girls. Even me—the prettiest girl in front of him—he doesn’t even sway to my beauty. I hate it!(Actual response): "Who is it, boss?"</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (still with a poker face): "This girl—I almost hit her. I want you to check her background."</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo handed Lorenza a photo.</pre> 
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (shocked and jealous, thinking): What? I can’t believe it. For years, we’ve encountered almost perfect women, and he never cared about any of them. How could he take an interest in this cheap girl? You’re so stupid!(Actual response): "Understood."</pre> 
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a poker face): "Don’t do anything bad to her."</pre>

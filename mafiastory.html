    <pre id="title">Heart of the Mafia</pre>
    <pre id="Chapter">Chapter 1</pre>
    <pre id="story">A world where everyone has their own fears and weaknesses, a man named Denzo has none. He is a perfectionist, even about his appearance, allowing no flaws. Denzo does not let any emotion get in his way, and he is a genius with an IQ surpassing Albert Einstein's, scoring at 240.</pre>
    <pre id="story">But one day, something unexpected happens.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (secretary): Boss, here’s the status of our businesses. According to the profit reports, things are going well.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a poker face and a dangerous gaze): Hand it over.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (gazing flirtatiously at her boss): Here you go, boss.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (still with a poker face and a dangerous gaze): The report says our business profits have dropped by a percentage. We need a 300% profit margin. I want you to investigate why this is happening.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (thinking about how cool and handsome he always is): Okay, boss.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (in a very masculine voice): I also want you to get me our CEO’s bank account information and hand it over.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (a bit surprised): Sure, I'll be back, boss.</pre>
    <pre id="story">Meanwhile, in Francine’s life...</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (with a lovely expression and a smile): Hello, my little baby, Laurel. I made breakfast for you, so make sure to eat it before going to school.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Laurel (with a sad expression): You again? Where’s Mom? I’m jealous of the kids at school whose moms or dads always drop them off.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (turns her head slightly, with a touch of sadness): I still have a lot to do, but you can eat now, and I’ll drop you off afterward.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Laurel (with a sad face, eating his food): Okay.</pre>
    <pre id="story">---</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine drops Laurel off at school.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (with a happy face): Bye! Love you, baby!</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Laurel (in a hurry): Okay.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (a bit sad): Don’t you want to say "I love you" back to your sister?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Laurel pretends he didn’t hear it and heads inside the school.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Francine (with a bit of sadness): That kid… I can’t blame him either.</pre>
    <pre id="story">...In Denzo’s Life...</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo stands up from his chair and heads to his basement, where all his vehicles are stored. He picks his black bike to ride to a meeting with a client.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">This client isn’t just any average client but a major business owner who wants to buy gold and weapons from him. Denzo has also created a laboratory for futuristic weapons, which he sells. Riding at full speed, he controls 80% of the traffic flow, flanked by his men in bulletproof cars and motorcycles, all black with the logo of their mafia.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo even has deals with the president since the country is deeply corrupt.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo arrives at his destination. A large number of men are waiting for him, all in suits. Denzo's bodyguards surround him, and they enter a large restaurant that the client bought out just for this meeting.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo sits at the table and begins to talk.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Client (with a smile on his face and a greedy look of power): Oh, there you are. You arrived exactly on time. You really are a perfectionist.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious and dangerous look): Let’s get to the point. What do you want to buy?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Client (laughing): You are very unfriendly. I guess the rumors are true—you have no emotion. I like that. I want to buy gold worth 50 billion dollars and futuristic weapons worth another 50 billion.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (a bit disappointed): I guess you don’t really know me, do you?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo stands up and turns his back.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Client (laughing, looking proud): You’ve passed the test, and now you have my trust. I want you to be my supplier, and I'll give you five businesses worth billions of dollars.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious look as he sits down again): I see. I guess you do know me.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Client (smiling confidently): Of course, you’re the man who meets clients not for money but for business property. Even if it’s 500 billion dollars, you still won’t accept it.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious look): Sure. You can count on me.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo shakes the client’s hand, signs the contracts, and goes outside, getting into a car.</pre>
    <pre id="story">---</pre>
    <pre id="storys">...On the phone with Lorenza...</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious yet smiling face): Kill him...</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (giggling at his masculine voice): Understood, boss.</pre>
    <pre id="story">---</pre>
    <pre id="storys">...On the phone with the President...</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (with a smirk on her face): Mr. President? Would you mind lending me a missile? Just one, big enough for a restaurant.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (with excitement and happiness at the thought of money): How much are we talking about?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (with a serious face and sultry voice): Just a billion dollars.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (surprised): Do you think that's enough?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (smirking): I might need to tell my boss that you declined our offer.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (with fear): No! Wait, I accept!</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (serious): How sure are you?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (with fear): You can just offer me 100 million dollars.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (in a teasing tone): So you’re not 100% sure, are you?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (nervous): I’ll do it for free! Just please don’t say anything to him.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (playfully): I want to buy it. How much?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (with confusion and sadness): I’ll sell it for 5 billion dollars.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (happily): Come on, don’t be afraid; I’ll buy it for 50 billion dollars.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Mr. President (confused and surprised): Thank you! Sure, I’ll do it. Send me the location.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza returns to Denzo’s office and hands over the CEO's bank information, telling him about the conversation with the President.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious gaze): Checkmate.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (confused): Why, boss?</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a serious gaze and a hint of anger): Summon all the CEOs at the golf course tomorrow. Tell them we’re going to have some fun together.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Lorenza (still confused): Sure, I’ll do it.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">The next day, Denzo arrives at the golf course on horseback, with his men. He has taken some of the CEOs' families hostage.</pre>
    <pre id="storys">Denzo (with a smile): To make this day more enjoyable, I brought your families along so we can have more fun.</pre>
